# Flow Driving

Flow Driving is an interactive driving game that uses hand gestures or arrow keys for control. The game leverages the power of Three.js for 3D rendering and AI models for hand gesture recognition.

## Features

- Control the car using arrow keys or hand gestures.
- Realistic 3D graphics powered by Three.js.
- Hand gesture recognition using MediaPipe.
- Start screen with game instructions.
- Game over screen with options to restart or go to the home screen.
- Responsive design for different screen sizes.
